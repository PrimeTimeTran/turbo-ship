5 Pillars of Decentralized Finance


1. Stable Coins
  Coinbase & Gemini are controlled by people
  Coinbase & Gemini take too much time and you have to pay taxes
  Stable Coins are code and can be inspected
  Easier way than transferring fiat to between banks and yourself
  Could change 10,000,000 no problem

2. Borrowing & Lending

  Key Points:
    - Over collateralize loans
    - Users can borrow money using crypto they currently hold.
    - Smart contracts allow people to use our funds while still keeping custody of them

  Example:
    ETH you use as collateral
    10 x 100 = $1000

    Borrow Tether $800

    3 months later need to repay $850

    But in that time ETH has risen
    10 x 150 = $1500

  Companies:
    AAVE

  Flash Loan

3. Decentralized Exchanges

  Key Points:
    - Unchanging
      - Fees
    - Investors

    - No Forex trader
    - Immutable code
    - Code is the law
    - Everyone has access to the code


  Companies
    - Uniswap
    - Pancake swap

4. Insurance

  Key Points:
    - Pay for insurance to protect yourself.
    - Insurance company is code
    - Smart contracts which checks conditions and executes if they evaluate to tree.
    - Oracles: Trusted sources which are bridges between real world and blockchain world/smart contract

  Key Points:
    - Loan which will automatically sell stock if it goes below down payment
    - Want to buy Apple stock $100
      $20 + 5% 

      - Stock rises to $150
        - You sell for 150(price) - 80(balance) = $70 profit
      - Stock drops to $80
        - You sell for 80(price) - 80(balance) = $20 loss(original 20 borrowed)

    - High fees(traditional)
    - Quicker because don't need to prove who you are.
