# Best Blogging Platform for Developers

In 2023 there are many options for what to use as a blogging platform. As is common in other areas of software development, the best
tool depends on what your requirements are.

Considerations you should consider before selecting a blogging platform are.

- Do I need an admin panel for non developer editors?
- Do I need a WYSIWYG editor?
- Do I require Markdown support?
- Do I want to maintain a database?
- Do I require syntax highlighting for code support?
- Which frontend frameworks are my team & I familiar with?
- Do I need built in SEO analysis support?
