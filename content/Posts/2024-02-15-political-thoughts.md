# A concerned citizen

The government should seed parks such as these for unfortunate souls who cannot claim America 🇺🇸 as their home. 

In these small towns, these souls can proclaim with their hearts to the world that America is not yet a dream 🛌. 

Souls, soldiers, and the future of the world that live and support such sanctuaries should sequester long enough such that they assimilate into their consciousness what it means to be an American. 

To know that we are all equal before God no matter how high or how low. Although this is the “promised land” that every many must fight his own battle no matter how high or how low. That on Earth God acts through man’s work and that man’s work is both the law and the will of the people of the land.

And in so doing they can give testament to the world that we are not yet that city on that hill, that America 🇺🇸 is a land of many nations where each man speaks his own language and must defend his land, tribe, and family with his sweat, toil, tears, blood & life if necessary.

Such might the American people know that we gave these unfortunate souls the same opportunities that they would give any American. And not only did they give these wretched souls what they would give a fellow America but a new dream & a new hope. Although we were divided there came a time when we once again united. 

These nations understood that divided we were all destined to fail but united we would create a new light.

And in so doing so we can more easily create a social harmony within these 50 states where public servants can more easily provide public services such as schools and foster an environment where private interest might not only prosper but produce progeny not only for the world but the world of nations.

For as surely as our forefathers created what laws they could given their circumstances of history & time for those they thought equal there is no authority to deport these asylum seekers, these wretched souls. 

Why put off until tomorrow what we ought to do today? We should help them facilitate their assimilation and sweat that they might live, honoring the memory of the natives who supported our pilgrims on Thanksgiving. 

In this way, we might advantage not only them but ourselves in that they might sacrifice not only the privilege of their homeland's comfort but of their own children in the hope of helping build that city on a hill that was promised not only to them but to us. 

In such a way these souls might have at the end of their arduous journey through that dark tunnel hope & light, if not for themselves but for their children; an American 🇺🇸 dream.
