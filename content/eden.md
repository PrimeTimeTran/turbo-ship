The government should seed parks such as these for unfortunate souls who cannot claim America 🇺🇸 as their home. 
In these small towns these souls can proclaim with their hearts to the world that America is not yet a dream 🛌. 

Souls, soldiers, the future of the world that live and support such sanctuaries should sequester long enough such that they assimilate into their conscienceness what it means to be an American. 

To know that we are all equal before God no matter how high or how low. That although this is the “promised land” that every many must fight how own battle no matter how high or how low. That on Earth God acts through man’s work and that man’s work is both the law and the will of the people.

And in so doing they can give testament to the world that we are not yet a city on a hill, that even America 🇺🇸 is a land of many nations where each man must defend his land, tribe, and family with his life.

Such might the American people know that we gave these unfortunate souls the same opportunities that they would give any American. And not only did they give these wretched souls what they would give a fellow America but a new dream & a new hope. Although we were divided there came a time when we once again united. These nations understood that divided we were all destined to fail but united we would create a new light.

And in so doing so we can more easily create a social harmony where public servants can more easily provide public services such as schools and foster an environment where private interest might not only prosper but produce progeny not only for the world but the world of nations.

In such a way these souls might have at the end of their dark tunnel, our light, if not for themselves but for their children; an American 🇺🇸 dream.
