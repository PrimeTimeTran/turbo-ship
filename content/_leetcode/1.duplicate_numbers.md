# [217. Contains Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least **twice** in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

```sh
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

## Solution 1:

Transform the list to a set then count the length of the set compared to the length of the list.

`o(n)` because the `set()` function is linear. 

```py
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
```

## Solution 2:

Iterate the list's item's and use a dict to identify if the current item has previously been seen.

`o(log n)` by using a linear search through the list. When element is unseen add it as a key to the dict. If it is seen then return `True`.
In the situation the list is exhausted return `False`.

```py
class Solution:
  def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:    
    seen = {}

    for n in nums:
      if n in seen:
        return True
      else:
        seen[n] = True
    return False
```
