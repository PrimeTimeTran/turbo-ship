# React Native


## Introduction

I began my React journey in 2016 with a course from [Stephen Grider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephengrider/) on Udemy.

Originally created at Facebook(now Meta), [React Native](https://www.reactnative.dev) is a cross platform solution for building once & running everywhere.

Like Stephen I also once taught React Native. Specifically I taught it at [Facebook's Developer Circle Program](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2023/04/27/an-update-on-the-meta-developer-circles-program/). 

Through the program I was able to teach what I knew to a younger generation.

It was an incredible experience.

I was given the opportunity by [CoderSchool](https://www.coderschool.vn/en).

Although there were many lessons here are a few of my favorites.

## Lessons

A [Currency Converter](https://github.com/PrimeTimeTran/rn-currencyconverter). The purpose of this lesson was to teach the fundamentals of components, props & JSX.

Next was a popular game called [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/PrimeTimeTran/rn-RockPaperScissors) =). This lesson introduced state to students.

And lastly a [Google News](https://github.com/PrimeTimeTran/rn-GoogleNews) clone. The purpose of this project was to reinforce the previous lesson's concepts as well as introduce async/await to students.

## Take Away's
To an experienced dev those concepts are so basic. But to a new student they're definitely something that takes practice and a few good lessons/projects to grasp.
