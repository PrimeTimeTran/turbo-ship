# React Overview
UIs built with imperative programming.

I think of it the way we hope government, small, abstract concepts about goals which can drive decision making instead of a step by step description of how governments should act.

That seems abstract but before modern JS frameworks took over we had to manually update the UI after user actions...


A user clicks a button, we prevent the default behavior, then manually update the UI using JS globals such as `document` or by rendering the entire UI again with a UI template.
