# Zero Trust

## Mission

Responsibility & mission to protect DoD, National security systems, defense industrial base.
Secure networks. Many have legacy networks. Have many cyber security solutions layered. Can't do everything at once, one day at a time.

Origin 2010, Forester Research, technology didn't exist. Private companies have made it a reality since then.

## Rethinking Cyber strategy
## Highlights

- Assume breach has already occurred
- Network's today don't have breach mentality
- Data Centric
- IT doesn't matter, transport does
- Where it originates, how it travels, where it is stored
- Least privileged: Enforced
  - See no more, no less
- Validating users & devices
- Seems to be the future

## Capab

Crawl, walk, run,

Not a race. Secure data. Understand users. Understand devices. Understanding data flows. Laying down right policies & procedure in the network. Integrating them all together.


## Crawl
Where is your data? Cloud? On prem? Where does it originate?

Who is on my network? Someone now? Someone from 4 years ago? Active directory should be kept up to date. Validate users. Validate devices. Not anyone and everyone should be on network.
Users, devices, apps. Not all should be on. Even apps should be changed. A vulnerability can exist anywhere within the OSI model. Hardware, network, application, device, user.

## User perspective
Bandwidth increasing, responsive time are increasing.

Consider it a modernization effort.

How to sign into the network? 

Zero Trust is MFA...

## Security behind zero trust is strong

System Admin will find it easier... less noise in the network.

Will see real traffic which perhaps should be analyzed.
