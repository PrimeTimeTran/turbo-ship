## IDS/Zeek Networking Monitoring

Learn how signatures are created and used. Helpful when handed a pcap or packet capture to investigate.

Intrusion Detection Systems such as Snort or Suricata can help you identify suspicirous traffic. Zeek can help breakdown the pcap into digestable pieces for further analysis.

Spin up those tools, configure them to monitor traffic, then have them read known malicious PCAP that you can download from malware traffic analysis. See what signatures are provided. Use Zeek to read & parse PCAP. Learn how to use PCAP

## Setup Honeypot
Setup a host that seemingly has a bunch of valuable data to collect info from potential attackers.

Great way to identify attackers.

Make something some good they can't help but find it.

Spinup any honeypot. Use a cloud machine.

## Wazuh to SOAR Implementation
Setup, configure, injest logs; utilize SOAR to perform some kind of automation.

Not at lot of SOCKS know how to do that so far.

Spin up Wazuh. Have 1 agent reporting in. Integrate a free SOAR platform like shuffle & perform data enrichment.
